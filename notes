Notes:

Ended up not needing to rebuild the kernel.
To get the framebuffer support to work, we had to install v86d or something
so that  modprobe uvesafb would complete (check dmesg for error).

With that, we installed mplayer to player videos in the framebuffer
since pygame dropped support.  We can play the video (slow)
but there is not yet any audio.

Tried to get pulse audio working but it sucks.  Seems it wont work if you run
it as a root user so I have to run as desmond.  Running as desmond outputs
no sound (using .mp3, maybe different audio file?).  Running as desmond
is not allowed for framebuffer video support.  wtf

 to play audio/video in VirtualBox debian:
 
 root:  
    modprobe uvesafb

play video/audio:
    SDL_NOMNOUSE=1 mplayer -ao alsa -vo sdl swan.mp4
    
verify permissions of fb, tty and console:

ls -l /dev/fb0
ls -l /dev/tty*
ls -l /dev/console
